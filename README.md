   cd storelt-drive
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT=your_project_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE=your_database_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_USERS_COLLECTION=your_users_collection_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_FILES_COLLECTION=your_files_collection_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_BUCKET=your_bucket_id
   NEXT_APPWRITE_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

4. **Configure Appwrite**
   - Go to your Appwrite Console
   - Set up database collections and storage bucket
   - Configure permissions (see setup guide below)
   - Get your project credentials

5. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Debug configuration (optional)**
   Visit `http://localhost:3000/debug` to test your Appwrite setup

## Appwrite Setup Guide

### 1. Create Database Collections

**Users Collection:**
- Create: `role:all`
- Read: `role:all`
- Update: `role:all`
- Delete: `role:all`

**Required Attributes:**
- `fullName` (string, required)
- `email` (string, required, unique)
- `avatar` (string, required)
- `accountId` (string, required)

**Files Collection:**
- Create: `role:all`
- Read: `role:all`
- Update: `role:all`
- Delete: `role:all`

**Required Attributes:**
- `type` (string, required)
- `name` (string, required)
- `url` (string, required)
- `extension` (string, required)
- `size` (integer, required)
- `owner` (string, required)
- `accountId` (string, required)
- `users` (string[], required)
- `bucketFileId` (string, required)

### 2. Configure Storage Bucket

Set file permissions to:
- Create: `role:all`
- Read: `role:all`
- Update: `role:all`
- Delete: `role:all`

### 3. API Keys

Ensure your secret key has permissions for:
- Users (read, write)
- Databases (read, write)
- Storage (read, write)

## Development

```bash
# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Project not found" error**
   - Verify your project ID in `.env.local`
   - Check that the project exists in your Appwrite console

2. **"User unauthorized" error**
   - Set all collection and bucket permissions to "Any" for development
   - Verify your API key has the correct permissions
   - Check that collections and bucket exist

3. **Environment variables not loading**
   - Ensure `.env.local` is in the project root
   - Restart your development server
   - Check variable names match exactly

### Debug Tools

Visit `/debug` page to:
- Check environment variables
- Test Appwrite connection
- Validate configuration
- Get setup instructions
